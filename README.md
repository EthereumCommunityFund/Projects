# Ethereum Community Fund (ECF)

![banner](resources/ecfnetwork.png)

Blockchains, crypto-assets, and decentralized applications are the most
transformative innovations of our generation. While poised for substantial
growth over the coming years, mainstream adoption remains at an early stage,
and the appropriate public infrastructure to support billions of users is still
a matter of deep R&D.

The aim of the Ethereum Community Fund (ECF) is to provide both funding and
connectivity, while shaping the strategic direction of the space towards
mainstream adoption through the development of infrastructure and compelling
end-user applications.

The first step towards supporting the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem will be
the Infrastructure Grant program. This program will be established as a
permanent financial endowment to support and aid projects in building crucial
open-source infrastructure, tooling, and applications.

## ECF Project Applications and Updates

This repository is the main entrypoint to project applications and updates.

Please submit your proposal by submitting a PR into the "applications" folder.

NOTE: We are also working on an alternative application process for
applications that should not be published to the public.  While we expect most
of the projects funded to come through this public process in GitHub, we will
also consider applications via alternative channels as well.  Please stay tuned
here, or reach out to any of our member projects for more information.

## Recommended Projects of Interest

Similar to how Ycombinator put out requests for projects, the ECF will 
organize a list of project areas of interest in the "recommended" folder.
Please watch out for updates.
